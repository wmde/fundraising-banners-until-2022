    It's a little awkward, so we'll get straight to the point:
    {{ weekdayPrepPhrase }} {{ currentDayName }} we humbly ask you to protect Wikipedia's independence.
    We depend on donations averaging about â‚¬&nbsp;21.48, but 99% of our readers don't give.
    Our fundraising appeal is displayed over {{ amountBannerImpressionsInMillion }} million times a day,
    but currently only {{ numberOfDonors }} people have donated.

    <span class="text__highlight">If everyone reading this gave a small amount, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come.</span>

    The price of your {{ currentDayName }} coffee is all we need.
    When we made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned us we'd regret it.
    But if Wikipedia became commercial, it would be a great loss to the world.
    Wikipedia is a place to learn, not a place for advertising.
    It unites all of us who love knowledge: contributors, readers and the donors who keep us thriving.
    The heart and soul of Wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable, neutral information.
    Please take a minute to help us keep Wikipedia growing. Thank you!
