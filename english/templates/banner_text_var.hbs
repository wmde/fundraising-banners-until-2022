	It's a little awkward, so we'll get straight to the point: {{ weekdayPrepPhrase }} {{ currentDayName }}
	we humbly ask you to protect Wikipedia's independence. We depend on donations averaging about 20 Euros, but 99% of
	our readers don't give.
	<span class="text__highlight">
		If everyone reading this gave a small amount, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come.

	The price of your {{ currentDayName }} coffee is all we need. When we made Wikipedia a non-profit,
	people warned us we'd regret it. But if Wikipedia became commercial, it would be a great loss to the world.
	Wikipedia is a place to learn, not a place for advertising. It unites all of us who love knowledge:
	contributors, readers and the donors who keep us thriving. The heart and soul of Wikipedia is a community
	of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable, neutral information.
	Please take a minute to help us keep Wikipedia growing. Thank you!
