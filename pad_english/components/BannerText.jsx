			<span className="text__highlight text__headline--bold"> If everyone reading this gave a small amount, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come.</span>

			<span> The price of your { currentDayName } coffee is all we need.
			When we made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned us we'd regret it.
			But if Wikipedia became commercial, it would be a great loss to the world.
			Wikipedia is a place to learn, not a place for advertising.
			It unites all of us who love knowledge: contributors, readers and the donors who keep us thriving.
			The heart and soul of Wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable,
			neutral information.
				Please take a minute to help us keep Wikipedia growing. Thank you!</span>
